#NAME:
Siri for Mac

#VERSION:
1.0.1

#DESCRIPTION:
Siri for Mac uses the Wolfram Alpha API to look up answers to questions that you ask. It also has the ability to do a small task of opening applications on your computer. Hopefully, this feature can be expanded and more sophisticated ones can be added in the future.

#REQUIREMENTS:
You'll need to provide a Wolfram Alpha API ID in order for the program to retrieve data from Wolfram Alpha. You can get one by signing up at http://www.wolframalpha.com and you can place it in the constant at the top labeled "WRA_APP_ID".

#INSTALLATION:
Run siri.php from your home folder for the program to automatically append the Siri() function into your .profile.
